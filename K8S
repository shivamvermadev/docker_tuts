Kubernetes 
If we want to run multiple types of images on same machine, K8s is the solution
minikube is the tool that is used to setup kubernetes on the local machine
minikube is going to create kubernetes cluster on your local machine, behind the scenes it creates virtual machines whose sole purpose is run some number of containers.
kubectl is the program used for managing these containers

The config files that we create are in kubernetes are used to create Objects
Objects serve different purpose like running containers, monitoring a container, setting up networking etc.

Object like pods are used to run containers, Objects like service is used to setup networking

when we ran minikube start, it created a virtual machine on our computer, we refer to that virtual machine running on my computer as a node, this node is going to be used by kubernetes to run some number of different objects
The most basic object that we are going to create is a pod
the pod is essentially a grouping of containers with a very common purpose, basically the multiple containers running inside the pod are tightly coupled with each other and have high dependency

The smallest thing that we can deploy in kubernetes is a pod, so we are always going to be deploying containers within a pod

There are 4 types of services -> ClusterIP, NodePort(Exposes container to the outside world, only good for dev purpose), LoadBalancer, Ingres.


When we create a service of type NodePort, its gonna setup a communication layer between the outside world and container running inside the pod. 
THere is also this thing called kube-proxy, every single node of kubernetes cluster have this program on it called kube-proxy
Kube-proxy is essentially a one single window to the outside world, so at any time a requests comes into a node its going to flow to kube-proxy, this proxy is going to inspect this request and route it to different services

feeding config files to minikube -> kubectl apply -f filename.yml

Print the status of all running pods -> kubectl get pods
Print the status of all running services -> kubectl get services
minikube ip -> will print out the IP address of that virtual machine
